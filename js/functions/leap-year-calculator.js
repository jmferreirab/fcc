Build a Leap Year Calculator

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not. Also, a leap year has an extra day in February, which is the 29th day of the month.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

Define a function called isLeapYear that takes a number as an argument.

Outside the function, declare a variable year that stores the value of the year you want to check.

Inside the function, use an if/ else statement or a ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year.

To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions:

If the year is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year.
Unless the year is also divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year.
Unless the year is also divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
If the year is a leap year, return [year] is a leap year.. Otherwise, return [year] is not a leap year.. You will replace [year] with the parameter defined in the isLeapYear function.

You should call the isLeapYear function with year as the argument and assign the result to a variable named result.

You should output the result variable to the console using console.log().

let year = 1900;

function isLeapYear(year) {
  let div4 = year % 4 === 0;
  let div400 = year % 400 === 0;
  let div100 = year % 100 === 0;
  let leap_year = (div4 && !div100) || div400;

  return `${year} ${leap_year ? "is" : "is not"} a leap year.`;

let result = isLeapYear(year);
console.log(result);

// console.log(isLeapYear(1896));
// console.log(isLeapYear(year));
// console.log(isLeapYear(1904)); // 8 year gap between leap years
