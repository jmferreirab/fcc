        What is the map method? And how does it work? The map method is a
        powerful and widely used function in JavaScript that operates on arrays.
        It is designed to create a new array by applying a given function to
        each element of the original array. This method does not modify the
        original array, but instead returns a new array containing the results
        of the function applied to each element. Here's an example of using the
        map method on an array of numbers to create a new array where each
        number is doubled, we are using the map method. The map method accepts a
        callback function where the function is called on every single element
        in the array. In this case, each number in the array will be multiplied
        by two, the result will be a new array of the numbers 246810. The
        callback function can accept up to three arguments. The first argument
        is the current element being processed. The second argument is the index
        of the current element being processed. The third argument is the array
        where map is being called on. Understanding and effectively using the
        map method can significantly improve your ability to work with arrays
        and JavaScript. In future lecture videos, we'll dive deeper into more
        advanced uses of map and explore how it can be a powerful tool for
        building dynamic and efficient programs.
