## HTML

> I have taken the freedom to add dark mode styling since I find it helpful to reduce eye strain.
> The original fcc labs from this section do not touch on custom styling in order to ease the learning curve.

### HTML Basics

1. Build a [recipe page](html/basic-html/recipe.html)

   Topics: HTML boilerplate, headings, lists, and images.

2. Build a [Travel agency page](html/basic-html/travel-agency.html)

3. Build a [Heart icon](html/basic-html/heart-icon.html)

   We use vector elements to create a heart icon.

4. Build a [video compilation](html/basic-html/video-compilation.html)
