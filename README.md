A repo to track my progress on fcc assignments.

## HTML Basics

1. Build a [recipe page](basic-html/recipe.html)

   In this lab, you'll review HTML basics by creating a web page of your favorite recipe. You'll create an HTML boilerplate and work with headings, lists, images, and more.

2. Build a [Travel agency page](basic-html/travel-agency.html)

   In this lab, you'll review working with HTML fundamentals by creating a web page for a travel agency. You'll work with images, the `figure` element, the `figcaption` element, the anchor element, and more.

3. Build a [Heart icon](basic-html/heart-icon.html)

4. Build a [video compilation](basic-html/video-compilation.html)

   We use the `iframe` element to embed youtube videos, and the semantic `section` element.
   Videos were selected intentionally to make an Unreal Engine learning resources page.
