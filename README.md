## HTML

> I have taken the freedom to add dark mode styling since I find it helpful to reduce eye strain.
> The original fcc labs from this section do not touch on custom styling in order to ease the learning curve.

### HTML Basics

1. Build a [recipe page](basic-html/recipe.html)

   A lab to get familiar with HTML boilerplate and work with headings, lists, and images.

2. Build a [Travel agency page](basic-html/travel-agency.html)

   A lab to practice working with with images, the `figure` element, the `figcaption` element, and the anchor element.

3. Build a [Heart icon](basic-html/heart-icon.html)

   We use `path` and the `svg` element attributes to create a heart icon.

4. Build a [video compilation](basic-html/video-compilation.html)

   We use the `iframe` element to embed youtube videos, and the semantic `section` element.
   Videos were selected intentionally to make an Unreal Engine learning resources page.

### Semantic HTML

1. Build a [Cat Blog Page](basic-html/cat-blog.html)

   A self-explanatory guided workshop at FCC. It serves to practice using semantic html elements like `nav`, `header`, `main`, `footer`, and `address`.

2. Build an [Event Hub Page](basic-html/event-hub.html)

   A lab to practice using semantic html elements; the page holds info on future and past imaginary thematic events.
