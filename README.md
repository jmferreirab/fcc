# freecodecamp assignments

A repo to track my progress on fcc assignments.

## HTML Basics

> [!NOTE]
> I have taken the freedom to add dark mode styling since I find it helpful to reduce eye strain.
> The original fcc labs from this section do not touch on custom styling in order to ease the learning curve.

1. Build a [recipe page](basic-html/recipe.html)

   A lab to get familiar with HTML boilerplate and work with headings, lists, and images.

2. Build a [Travel agency page](basic-html/travel-agency.html)

   A lab to practice working with with images, the `figure` element, the `figcaption` element, and the anchor element.

3. Build a [Heart icon](basic-html/heart-icon.html)

4. Build a [video compilation](basic-html/video-compilation.html)

   We use the `iframe` element to embed youtube videos, and the semantic `section` element.
   Videos were selected intentionally to make an Unreal Engine learning resources page.
